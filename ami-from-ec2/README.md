# AMI from EC2 Hands-On

This project demonstrates how to create a custom Amazon Machine Image (AMI) from an EC2 instance and launch new instances from that AMI.

## Objective
To understand how EC2 snapshots and AMIs work, and how to preserve configuration/state across multiple launches.

## What was done
- Launched EC2 and installed Apache with a custom index.html
- Created AMI from that EC2
- Launched new EC2s from the AMI
- Verified that configurations were retained
