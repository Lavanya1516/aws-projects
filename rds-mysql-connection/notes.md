# 📘 Notes

- ❗ Initially forgot to add inbound rule → connection refused
- ✅ After adding port 3306 from my IP → SQL Electron connected
- GUI clients like DBeaver or SQL Electron are easier to demo
- This demo proves:
  - RDS setup knowledge
  - Network config (SG + public IP)
  - Real connection, not theoretical
