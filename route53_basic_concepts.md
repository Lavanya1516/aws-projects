# 🌐 Domain, DNS, and Route 53 — Explained Simply

## 📛 What is a Domain?
- A domain is a **human-readable name** used to access websites or services.
- Example: `lavanya.com` instead of an IP like `192.0.2.1`
- Domains are registered and managed through services like Route 53 or GoDaddy.

---

## 🔁 What is DNS (Domain Name System)?
- DNS translates **domain names into IP addresses**.
- Think of it as the **internet’s phonebook**.
- Example:
  ```
  www.lavanya.com → 54.87.112.91
  ```
- Every time you open a website, DNS is silently working in the background.

## 🧭 What is Route 53?

Route 53 is AWS’s **scalable, highly available DNS service**.

### ✨ Key Features:
- **Domain Registration**: Buy and manage domains (e.g. `lavanya.com`)
- **DNS Service**: Create Hosted Zones and manage DNS records
- **Health Checks**: Monitor endpoints and reroute traffic if unhealthy
- **Traffic Routing**: Smart routing using:
  - Latency-based
  - Geolocation-based
  - Weighted routing
  - Failover routing
- **AWS Integration**: Easily connect EC2, S3, ALB, CloudFront, etc.
